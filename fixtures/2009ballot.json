I believe in freedom,              liberty,              and equality.  I believe that justice is crucial and that every man has  good  within him.  I know ignorance is a result of a lack of education,              a malady that is treatable.  I believe a mental fight is as,              if not more,              wounding as a physical battle.  I believe that every cloud has a silver lining,              and that an optimistic outlook is necessary for a successful life.  And as for success I believe that it is measured not by the size of one's wallet but by the smile on one's face.\nWhat do I stand for?  Well,              for one,              I believe that the school with the third largest endowment in the country at over $15 billion should not be cutting more programs and laying off more faculty than many peer schools around the country.  Adequate funding for student organizations and for student wellness is my number one priority.  I am also a strong advocate for reforming the dining system so it is more open to vegetarians and various religious groups,              as well as more realistic in terms of Cardinal dollar allotments.  Finally,              I strongly support sustainability and health initiatives.        \n",

The frivolity of some senators,              non-substantive agenda of the senate and occasional partisan bickering does not appeal to the wider body. As a senator I intend to change that. The senate needs to function as an adult organization that can engage with wider campus community and administration about student issues such as tuition,              housing,              and food services. This is why I am running for senate. In a year of financial crisis like this one,              I will propose that the student groups make small budgetary sacrifices to save jobs of some of the lowest paid Stanford employees who are at risk of losing their jobs but are essential part of student services. My motto for the campaign is responsibility,              respect,              and service to the community. I do not know of any Stanford Undergraduate Senator who has been invited to any late night comedy show. We are not good comedians; so why engage in vacuity in senate race? Let us get substantive in our agenda,              so that we are taken seriously and earn respect from the community we live in.\n",

I also want to work toward maintaining fair stipends in relation to cost-of-living and economic conditions.\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\nPrior to Stanford,              I had several opportunities to help make a difference in my community.  Notably,              as an undergrad,              I met with Cornell's Vice President to establish and coordinate  CU Tsunami Relief  days after the crisis in Indonesia.  Shortly after graduating,              I was one of the earliest members to help build TerraCycle Inc.,              an eco-friendly company which  upcycles' trash into products which are currently sold nationally in Target,              Office Max,              Home Depot,              and others.  As a third year student who has always lived on campus and serves as a Community Associate (CA),              I have become more familiar with Stanford's graduate community and resources.

I can therefore relate very well to the concerns of both International and U.S. students. \nGSC positions held 2008-09:\nElected member (At-Large)\nFinancial Officer (oversaw ~$310,             000 budget)\nNewsletter Editor\nHousing Advocacy Committee Co-Chair\nGrad Challenge Committee Chair\nASSU Financial Manager Selection Committee\n\nOther University positions held 2008-09\nGraduate Housing Advisory Committee Member\nEV Community Associate\nDepartment of Psychology Class Representative\n\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student representative?\nIn the current economic crisis,              we are seeing many budget cuts within the university. I would advocate for preserving the programs (both academic and social) that are most important to graduate students and would also work with the university administration to assess what new programs that would benefit grad students could be established despite decrease in resources. \nSince I believe that a good living environment not only promotes happiness,              but is also crucial for academic and professional achievement and creativity,              I would continue to advocate for improvements in Housing (availability of affordable options,              expansion of Housing if demand continues to rise,              community improvements,              etc.) and foster grad social life by encouraging students to interact with a diverse group of individuals and providing the opportunities to do so.\nI would also work to support other ongoing GSC initiatives,              such as dependent healthcare and work on international student issues.\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\nMy experience as a GSC member is listed above. At Stanford,              I also served as the SBDT Graduate Relations Chair and Space Coordinator in 2007-08. Outside of Stanford,              I have accumulated experience in various academic and non-academic leadership positions. \nIn addition,              I am very ambitious,              but also realistic,              and I am very persistent and dependable when it comes to achieving goals. I have experience in being a bridge between (groups of) people with differing,              sometimes competing,              concerns. I am very interested in continuously assessing and representing the needs of the graduate student community as I believe that communication between the community and its representatives is extremely important. Based on my previous experience in the GSC and my connections to fellow grad students in my school and in the residences,              I believe I have the skills and resources to represent you well.\n",

I am enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (IPER),              which,              although housed in the School of Earth Sciences,              seeks to interact with a broad range of programs and disciplines.  I am actively engaged in a broad range of activities here at Stanford,              which includes being Vice President of SNAGS,              CFO of the Coastal Society,              team leader for SECG,              active member of SEEDS,              Hui o Hawaii,              SSS,              and the Energy Club,              a mentor for PAE-V,              and a host of other involvements.  \n\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student representative?\nMy priorities as a GSC representative will be to accurately understand and relate the needs of the graduate students to the Stanford administration and other student councils,              and to not bring my own agenda to the GSC,              but the agenda of the graduate students.  My broad interests and interdisciplinary program enhances my interaction across the seven Stanford schools,              and allows me to understand the diverse needs and wants of Stanford graduate students.  I am heavily involved with a broad range of student groups and activities,              and engage in a broad spectrum of leadership that includes organizing drunken social events to seriously petitioning the appropriate use of funds and resources on campus.  I believe that this high level of diverse activity qualifies me to accurately represent the needs of the graduate population.\n \n\n\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\nMy previous leadership experience is extensive; I have managed budgets of half a million dollars and coordinated the efforts of thousands of people.  But what I would really bring to the GSC is a unique personality that is not afraid to stand up for what is ethically right,              is willing to listen to any idea with an open mind,              has the confidence to support action,              and that still enjoys good times and good company.  \n",

Also,              we need to tackle affordable housing,              health insurance,              and mental health.

My current responsibilities within the GSC have given me the opportunity to work with a number of individuals and organizations ranging from Stanford campus to Capitol Hill.\n\n\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student representative?\nThere tends to be a certain disconnect between the graduate student body and the internal workings of the GSC.  For instance,              GSC advocacy on issues such as dependent health care,              stipend reform,              and affordable on-campus housing often flies under the radar.  Having dealt with these issues both personally and with peers,              I think I could bring a greater degree of transparency and awareness to the process.  This same lack of awareness also leads to GSC funds being spent in a manner disproportionate to the desires of the entire graduate population (or not being spent at all).  As a GSC representative,              I would hope to bring fresh outside ideas to the organization,              while eliminating expenditures that benefit a small minority.\n \nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\nAs an undergraduate I served as president of one of nine residential colleges in the university-wide system.  As president,              I managed a budget of over $50,             000 and acted as the primary liaison between the administration and a significant portion of the student body.  More recently at Stanford I've had the opportunity to work with a number of administrators,              acted as the GSC liaison to the Undergraduate Senate,              and represented the graduate student body while lobbying in Washington,              D.C.  These experiences make me ideally suited for a position in which financial management and student advocacy are high priorities.",

Therefore,              I know very well how it feels to be an international student and what is needed to have a smooth adaptation to a new environment. I believe I can easily relate to diverse needs of Stanford students.   \n\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student representative?\nI believe that there are some artificial boundaries (aren't all boundaries artificial after all?) between different groups at Stanford. As an international student,              the one between American and international students is especially obvious to me. Therefore,              as a graduate student representative I will work toward bringing diverse student bodies closer to each other. I see that many international students spend their campus life in small groups. This is mostly because they don't really know what is going on outside of their narrow circles. Stanford has many resources for creating ideal venues for a much more cohesive campus life. We only need a broad vision and enthusiasm. This is a win-win outcome for any graduate student,              domestic or international.     \n \n\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\nLast year I worked in a policy-oriented NGO in Greece. Together with my team members I took part in organizing various international events. This helped me to improve my skills of working in a multi-cultural environment. I believe I will benefit from this experience in creating solutions to the problems of a very diverse graduate community at Stanford.  \n",
