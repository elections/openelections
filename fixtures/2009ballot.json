I have experience in being a bridge between (groups of) people with differing, sometimes competing, concerns. I am very interested in continuously assessing and representing the needs of the graduate student community as I believe that communication between the community and its representatives is extremely important. Based on my previous experience in the GSC and my connections to fellow grad students in my school and in the residences, I believe I have the skills and resources to represent you well.\r\n", "name4": "", "name5": "", "name2": "", "name3": "", "name1": "Nanna Notthoff", "sunetid2": "", "sunetid3": "", "sunetid1": "nanna", "slug": "nanna-notthoff", "sunetid4": "", "sunetid5": "", "kind": "GSC", "summary": ""}}, {"pk": 60, "model": "issues.issue", "fields": {"studentid4": "", "studentid5": "", "studentid1": "1", "studentid2": "", "studentid3": "", "image": "", "class_year": "", "district": "EarthSci", "title": "Noa Lincoln", "profile": "Name: Noa Lincoln\r\nSchool: Earth Sciences\r\nDepartment: IPER \r\nYear: 1st\r\n\r\nBesides your school and year, please offer any other demographic information you\u2028consider relevant.\r\nI am a first year PhD student hailing from Hawaii.  I am enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (IPER), which, although housed in the School of Earth Sciences, seeks to interact with a broad range of programs and disciplines.  I am actively engaged in a broad range of activities here at Stanford, which includes being Vice President of SNAGS, CFO of the Coastal Society, team leader for SECG, active member of SEEDS, Hui o Hawaii, SSS, and the Energy Club, a mentor for PAE-V, and a host of other involvements.  \r\n\r\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student\u2028representative?\r\nMy priorities as a GSC representative will be to accurately understand and relate the needs of the graduate students to the Stanford administration and other student councils, and to not bring my own agenda to the GSC, but the agenda of the graduate students.  My broad interests and interdisciplinary program enhances my interaction across the seven Stanford schools, and allows me to understand the diverse needs and wants of Stanford graduate students.  I am heavily involved with a broad range of student groups and activities, and engage in a broad spectrum of leadership that includes organizing drunken social events to seriously petitioning the appropriate use of funds and resources on campus.  I believe that this high level of diverse activity qualifies me to accurately represent the needs of the graduate population.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\r\nMy previous leadership experience is extensive; I have managed budgets of half a million dollars and coordinated the efforts of thousands of people.  But what I would really bring to the GSC is a unique personality that is not afraid to stand up for what is ethically right, is willing to listen to any idea with an open mind, has the confidence to support action, and that still enjoys good times and good company.  \r\n", "name4": "", "name5": "", "name2": "", "name3": "", "name1": "Noa Lincoln", "sunetid2": "", "sunetid3": "", "sunetid1": "noa", "slug": "noa-lincoln", "sunetid4": "", "sunetid5": "", "kind": "GSC", "summary": ""}}, {"pk": 61, "model": "issues.issue", "fields": {"studentid4": "", "studentid5": "", "studentid1": "1", "studentid2": "", "studentid3": "", "image": "", "class_year": "", "district": "Eng", "title": "Robert Hennessy", "profile": "Name: Robert Hennessy\r\nSchool: Engineering\r\nDepartment: Electrical Engineering\r\nYear: 2nd \r\n\r\nBesides your school and year, please offer any other demographic information you\u2028consider relevant.\r\nAs Co-Chair of the Graduate Student Programming Board for the last 1.5 years, I have organized social events for the graduate student community.

I held multiple leadership positions (IT Chair, New Projects Chair and Vice President) for the Tau Beta Pi chapter of UC Berkeley. Go Bears!  Finally, I am an Eagle Scout.\r\n\r\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student\u2028representative?\r\nDue to the worsening economic conditions, tough decisions will need to be made in the coming years. To that end, my goals are increased transparency, accountability and outreach to my constituents. We must use our dwindling money wisely. Also, we need to tackle affordable housing, health insurance, and mental health. The community should be strengthened by increased interdepartmental events and social programming. I will bring experience, new ideas and a fresh voice.\r\n \r\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\r\nSee above.", "name4": "", "name5": "", "name2": "", "name3": "", "name1": "Robert Hennessy", "sunetid2": "", "sunetid3": "", "sunetid1": "rhenn", "slug": "robert-hennessy", "sunetid4": "", "sunetid5": "", "kind": "GSC", "summary": ""}}, {"pk": 62, "model": "issues.issue", "fields": {"studentid4": "", "studentid5": "", "studentid1": "1", "studentid2": "", "studentid3": "", "image": "", "class_year": "", "district": "Eng", "title": "Ryan Peacock", "profile": "Name: Ryan Peacock\r\nSchool: Engineering\r\nDepartment: Chemical Engineering\r\nYear: 3rd\r\n\r\nBesides your school and year, please offer any other demographic information you\u2028consider relevant.\r\nI currently serve as an at-large voting member of the Graduate Student Council and represent Stanford as a board member of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.  My current responsibilities within the GSC have given me the opportunity to work with a number of individuals and organizations ranging from Stanford campus to Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student\u2028representative?\r\nThere tends to be a certain disconnect between the graduate student body and the internal workings of the GSC.  For instance, GSC advocacy on issues such as dependent health care, stipend reform, and affordable on-campus housing often flies under the radar.  Having dealt with these issues both personally and with peers, I think I could bring a greater degree of transparency and awareness to the process.  This same lack of awareness also leads to GSC funds being spent in a manner disproportionate to the desires of the entire graduate population (or not being spent at all).  As a GSC representative, I would hope to bring fresh outside ideas to the organization, while eliminating expenditures that benefit a small minority.\r\n \r\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\r\nAs an undergraduate I served as president of one of nine residential colleges in the university-wide system.  As president, I managed a budget of over $50,000 and acted as the primary liaison between the administration and a significant portion of the student body.  More recently at Stanford I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with a number of administrators, acted as the GSC liaison to the Undergraduate Senate, and represented the graduate student body while lobbying in Washington, D.C.  These experiences make me ideally suited for a position in which financial management and student advocacy are high priorities.", "name4": "", "name5": "", "name2": "", "name3": "", "name1": "Ryan Peacock", "sunetid2": "", "sunetid3": "", "sunetid1": "rpeacock", "slug": "ryan-peacock", "sunetid4": "", "sunetid5": "", "kind": "GSC", "summary": ""}}, {"pk": 63, "model": "issues.issue", "fields": {"studentid4": "", "studentid5": "", "studentid1": "1", "studentid2": "", "studentid3": "", "image": "", "class_year": "", "district": "H&S-Hum", "title": "Ugur Pece", "profile": "Name: Ugur Pece\r\nSchool: Humanities and Sciences\r\nDepartment: History\r\nYear: 1st\r\n\r\nBesides your school and year, please offer any other demographic information you\u2028consider relevant.\r\nI grew up in Istanbul, Turkey and lived two years in Athens, Greece before I came to Stanford. Therefore, I know very well how it feels to be an international student and what is needed to have a smooth adaptation to a new environment. I believe I can easily relate to diverse needs of Stanford students.   \r\n\r\nWhat are the most important goals you would work toward as a graduate student\u2028representative?\r\nI believe that there are some artificial boundaries (aren\u2019t all boundaries artificial after all?) between different groups at Stanford. As an international student, the one between American and international students is especially obvious to me. Therefore, as a graduate student representative I will work toward bringing diverse student bodies closer to each other. I see that many international students spend their campus life in small groups. This is mostly because they don\u2019t really know what is going on outside of their narrow circles. Stanford has many resources for creating ideal venues for a much more cohesive campus life. We only need a broad vision and enthusiasm. This is a win-win outcome for any graduate student, domestic or international.     \r\n \r\n\r\nWhat previous experience and/or special skills and interests do you bring to the position?\r\nLast year I worked in a policy-oriented NGO in Greece. Together with my team members I took part in organizing various international events. This helped me to improve my skills of working in a multi-cultural environment. I believe I will benefit from this experience in creating solutions to the problems of a very diverse graduate community at Stanford.  \r\n", "name4": "", "name5": "", "name2": "", "name3": "", "name1": "Ugur Pece", "sunetid2": "", "sunetid3": "", "sunetid1": "ugur", "slug": "ugur-pece", "sunetid4": "", "sunetid5": "", "kind": "GSC", "summary": ""}}]
